# spin-soccer
This is a 2 player arcade-style sports game built using Python and Pygame Library. It was built to demonstrate use of the Pygame library to students at the ESAP program.

## Running the game

This game makes use of the Pygame library, which is [available for free online.](http://pygame.org/wiki/GettingStarted). Once you have Pygame installed, simply run the main.py file.

## How to Play

This is a two-player game played using one keyboard. The controls are as follows:

Key | Player 1 | Player 2
---|---|---
Movement | WASD | Arrow Keys
Spin left | Z  | ,
Hold Ball | X | .
Spin Right | C | /

The goal is to throw the ball into your opponents goal. Pick up the ball by holding Hold Ball and throw by releasing that key. The ball will be thrown with whatever momentum is had; so, to generate a high velocity shot you will need to be moving in the direction of your throw and spinning the ball.
